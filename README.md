# GLow
GLow is an open source screensaver for Windows using shaders. The shaders are small programs for the graphics card of your computer. Very good quality shaders can be downloaded automatically from the website ShaderToy to offer you beautiful animations (2D and 3D) on the screen when you are not using the computer.
